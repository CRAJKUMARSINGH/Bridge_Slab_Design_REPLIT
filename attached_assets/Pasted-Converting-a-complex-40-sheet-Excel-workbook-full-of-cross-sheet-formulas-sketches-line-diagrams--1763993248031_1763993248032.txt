Converting a complex 40-sheet Excel workbook (full of cross-sheet formulas, sketches, line diagrams, and bridge design calculations) into a professional, reusable **React + Vite** web application is a big but very rewarding project. Here’s the realistic step-by-step roadmap and exactly what instructions you should give to “Kiro AI” (or any strong coding agent like Claude, GPT-4o, etc.) so you get usable results instead of hallucinations.

### Phase 0 – Preparation (you do this first, very important)
1. Clean & organize the Excel file
   - Put all input cells in one or two sheets called “Inputs” or “Project_Parameters”.
   - Put all final outputs/results in one sheet called “Summary” or “Results”.
   - Name every important range (Ctrl+F3 → Define Name) – this makes migration 10× easier.
   - Export every sheet that contains only data/tables (not sketches) as separate CSV or JSON files.
   - Take high-quality screenshots or export as PDF/PNG all sketches and line diagrams (you’ll embed them later).

2. Create a folder structure already
```
bridge-design-app/
├── public/
│   └── sketches/          ← put all your diagram images here
├── src/
│   ├── assets/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── data/              ← exported JSON/CSV from Excel
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── pages/ or views/
│   └── App.jsx
├── excel-to-json/         ← temporary folder with original .xlsx and scripts
└── vite.config.js
```

### Phase 1 – What to ask Kiro AI first (exact prompts that work in 2025)

**Prompt 1 – Extract all calculations to pure JavaScript/TypeScript**
```text
I have a bridge design Excel workbook with ~40 sheets. 
I already exported the following sheets as CSV/JSON: [list the files].

Please do this step by step:

1. Re-implement ALL the calculations and cross-sheet formulas in pure TypeScript/JavaScript functions (no Excel, no external libraries except math.js if needed).
2. Create one file per original Excel sheet called sheetName.calc.ts 
   Example: Superstructure.calc.ts, Abutment.calc.ts, etc.
3. Each file must export a function that receives an object "inputs" (all the input parameters) and returns an object with only the outputs of that sheet.
4. At the end create a file orchestrator.ts that calls all these functions in the correct dependency order and returns the complete results.
5. Use proper naming, JSDoc comments, and handle units (kN, m, MPa, etc.) as numbers with a separate unit string where needed.

Only output clean, runnable TypeScript code. No explanations outside code comments.
Attached files: [attach your cleaned Excel + CSVs/JSONs]
```

**Prompt 2 – Generate the React + Vite app skeleton (after you have the calculation code)**
```text
Create a modern React + TypeScript + Vite app for bridge design calculation.

Requirements:
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Responsive sidebar navigation with all 40+ original Excel sheet names grouped logically (Superstructure, Substructure, Seismic, etc.)
- One main "Inputs" page with tabs or sections for all user inputs (use Zod for validation)
- A "Results" page that shows tables and key values exactly like the Excel "Summary" sheet
- A "Diagrams" page that shows all the sketches/line diagrams I will put in public/sketches/ folder. Make it zoomable/pannable (use react-zoom-pan-pinch or similar)
- Use TanStack Table for any tabular output
- All calculations must be imported from the orchestrator.ts we created in the previous step
- Recalculate everything when inputs change (use React state + useEffect or Zustand)
- Add an Export to PDF button (using @react-pdf/renderer or html-to-pdf)

Generate the complete project structure with all files and code.
```

**Prompt 3 – Iterative refinement (one sheet at a time)**
After you get the big skeleton, go sheet by sheet:
```text
Implement the exact UI and calculations for the sheet "Pier_Capacity.xlsx" 
- Match the layout of the original Excel sheet as closely as possible
- Include the sketch image public/sketches/pier_capacity.png with labels
- Show all intermediate calculations in collapsible sections
- Highlight cells that are red/yellow in original Excel
```

### Recommended Tech Stack (2025)
- Vite + React 18 + TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Zustand or Jotai (lightweight state management)
- Zod for input validation
- math.js or numeric.js for advanced functions
- react-hook-form + Zod resolver
- TanStack Table (React Table v8)
- react-zoom-pan-pinch for diagrams
- @react-pdf/renderer for PDF export

### Realistic Timeline if you use AI heavily
- Week 1: Clean Excel + export data + Phase 1 (pure calc functions) → 80–90% automated with good prompts
- Week 2: Phase 2 skeleton app
- Week 3–6: One major section per day (superstructure, foundations, seismic, etc.) using Prompt 3

### Bonus – Tools that make it 10× faster
- Excel → JSON: Use “Excel to JSON” add-in or https://www.convertcsv.com/csv-to-json.htm
- Formula extraction: There is a new tool in 2025 called “Excel-to-Code” (by Anthropic) or “SheetJS + custom parser”
- Diagrams: Convert all sketches to SVG if possible (better zooming)

Start with Prompt 1 above — that is the hardest and most important part. Once you have clean calculation code, the React UI is relatively easy for any 2025 AI coder.

If you want, share one or two of the most complex sheets here and I’ll write the first .calc.ts files for you to use as template. Good luck — you’re basically building the next SkyCiv or midas Civil web version! 🚀
