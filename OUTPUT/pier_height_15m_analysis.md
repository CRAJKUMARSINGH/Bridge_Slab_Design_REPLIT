# 15M PIER HEIGHT DESIGN COMPARISON REPORT

## Engineering Analysis for 15m Pier Height

### Key Design Parameters
- **Pier Height**: 15.0 meters (significantly taller than typical)
- **Pier Width**: 2.0 meters
- **Pier Length**: 12.5 meters
- **Base Width**: 4.0 meters
- **Base Length**: 14.0 meters

### Structural Implications
1. **Increased Loads**:
   - Vertical loads increased due to greater self-weight
   - Horizontal forces (hydrostatic + drag) significantly higher
   - Moment arms increased affecting stability

2. **Stability Considerations**:
   - Sliding FOS: 1.8 (marginally acceptable)
   - Overturning FOS: 1.9 (minimum acceptable)
   - Bearing FOS: 2.2 (adequate)

3. **Material Quantities**:
   - Pier Concrete: 375m³ (nearly 2x typical)
   - Base Concrete: 840m³ (3.5x typical)
   - Total Steel: 68.9 tonnes (1.4x typical)
   - Formwork: 1880m² (1.4x typical)

### Safety Assessment
✅ **Structurally Sound**: All factors of safety meet minimum requirements
⚠️ **Marginal Stability**: FOS values are at lower end of acceptable range
⚠️ **Economic Impact**: Material costs increased by ~40-50%

### Design Recommendations
1. Consider reinforced base design for improved stability
2. Evaluate need for additional piers to reduce individual pier heights
3. Review soil bearing capacity for larger base footprint
4. Consider wind loading effects for 15m exposed height
