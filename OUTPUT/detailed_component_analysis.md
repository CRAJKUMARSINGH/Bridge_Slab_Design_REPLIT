4. **Footing**: Foundation interface (2821.21 kN)
5. **Foundation**: Soil bearing and stability

#### Horizontal Load Path
1. **Water Forces**: Hydrostatic and drag effects
   - Hydrostatic: 137.44 kN
   - Drag: 60.97 kN
   - Total: 209.1 kN (increased for 15m height)
2. **Wind Forces**: Exposure effects for 15m height
3. **Load Transfer**: Through rigid connections to foundation
4. **Stability Checks**: At footing level for sliding/bearing
