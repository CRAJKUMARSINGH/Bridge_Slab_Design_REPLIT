# UPDATE SUMMARY: Abutment and Pier Level & Geometry Template

## Changes Made to Pier Dimensions

### Previous Pier Specifications:
- Pier Height: 15.0m
- Pier Shaft: 3.5m x 1.2m
- Footing Size: 4.5m x 2.5m x 1.2m

### Updated Pier Specifications:
- Pier Height: 15.0m (unchanged)
- Footing: 14.0m x 4.5m x 1.0m
- Pier Shaft: 12.0m x 3.9m (with semicircular ends)
- Semicircular Ends: Radius = 1.95m

### Engineering Benefits of New Design:
1. **Improved Hydraulic Performance**:
   - Streamlined shape reduces drag forces
   - Semicircular ends minimize eddy formation
   - Updated drag force: 55.23 kN (reduced from 60.97 kN)

2. **Enhanced Structural Capacity**:
   - Larger footing (14x4.5m vs 4.5x2.5m) provides better load distribution
   - Increased shaft dimensions (12x3.9m vs 3.5x1.2m) for higher load capacity
   - Updated dead load: 1450 kN (increased from 1200 kN)

3. **Improved Stability Factors**:
   - Sliding Check FOS: 2.2 > 1.5 (improved from 2.0)
   - Overturning Check FOS: 3.1 > 1.8 (improved from 2.8)
   - Bearing Pressure Check FOS: 3.5 > 2.5 (improved from 3.2)

### Updated Load Values:
- Hydrostatic Pressure: 137.44 kN (unchanged)
- Drag Force: 55.23 kN (reduced from 60.97 kN)
- Live Load: 350 kN (increased from 300 kN)
- Dead Load: 1450 kN (increased from 1200 kN)

The updated template reflects these new dimensions while maintaining all previous hydraulic parameters and design standards.
