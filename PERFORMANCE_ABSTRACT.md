# Application Performance Report Abstract

## Overview
This document provides a 150-word summary of the APPLICATION_PERFORMANCE_REPORT.pdf, detailing the performance characteristics of the bridge design application across various test scenarios.

## Key Findings

The application was tested with four bridge design scenarios ranging from small (15m span) to high discharge configurations. All tests completed successfully with a 100% success rate, demonstrating system reliability.

Performance scales linearly with design complexity. Execution times ranged from 1.25 seconds for small bridges to 3.20 seconds for high discharge scenarios. Memory consumption increased proportionally from 45 MB to 129 MB, indicating efficient resource management.

Excel file generation produces outputs sized appropriately to design complexity, from 1.2 MB for small bridges to 3.4 MB for high discharge cases. The system maintains consistent performance characteristics across all test cases.

Average metrics show 2.3-second execution time, 88.7 MB memory usage, and 2.4 MB file size. The application demonstrates robust performance suitable for engineering design work with predictable scaling behavior and stable operation across diverse scenarios.
